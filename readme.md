# üìä Mini Data Query Simulation Engine

A lightweight backend service simulating a Gen AI Analytics tool that accepts natural language queries, interprets them as pseudo-SQL, and returns mock results ‚Äî designed for non-technical users to query data seamlessly.
<!-- 
> üîß Built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript as part of a Backend Engineering Internship assessment. -->

- Converts valid queries to pseudo-SQL (mock interpreter)
- Explains query breakdown (filters, group by, etc.)
- Validates queries and returns simulated results
- Lightweight JWT-based authentication
- In-memory session for last submitted query
